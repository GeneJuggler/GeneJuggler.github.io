I am Dr. Robert Pollok, but you can just call me Bob. I enjoy learning about science, hacking around in Python, sci-fi, videogames, and just about any other nerdy thing you can think of. I thought DrBob.zone could be a fun way to share my thoughts and experiences so... let's go!

If you want to shout back at me, I am on Twitter: @BobP_PhD
